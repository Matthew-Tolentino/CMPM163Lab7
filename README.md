I made my scene using the Shader Graphs on spheres, planes, lighting, and some free assets on the untiy store. To make the mountain range I applied some graph noise to the mesh similar to the tutorial and then made duplicates of that mesh while changing their scales to vary up the terrain. Finally I added a rotating light around the scene to better show the terrain.

Have reached out to my partner but am awaitng a response.
