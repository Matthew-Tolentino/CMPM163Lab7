I made my scene using the Shader Graphs on spheres, planes, lighting, and some free assets on the untiy store. To make the mountain range I applied some graph noise to the mesh similar to the tutorial and then made duplicates of that mesh while changing their scales to vary up the terrain. Finally I added a rotating light around the scene to better show the terrain.

Partner Check-In:  
 Question 1 - My partner did part 1.  
 Question 2 - My partner found going from coding to node based shaders was very difficult and hard to get the hang of.  
 Question 3 - My partner found that using a combination of shaders and materials to make the scene was that most interesting as it
              gave us more creative freedom.
